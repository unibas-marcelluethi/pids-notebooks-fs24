    "Next, you should evaluate your model. Scikit-learn provides various metrics for this purpose. We will use the mean squared error [mean_squared_error](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html#sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error) and the r2_score ([https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html#sklearn.metrics.r2_score]). While the mean squared error should be familiar, the r2score is maybe not. The r2_score (also known as the Coefficient of determination or measure of explained variance) is a dimensionless number typically ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 1 means that the data has been perfectly explained. A value of 0 means that the prediction is no better than if one had simply used the average of the target values for the prediction. Negative values indicate that the prediction is even worse than if one had not used the measurements at all and always estimated the mean value. \n",

Multilayer Perceptrons can be used for both regression and classification ([MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html)).
